# Sea surface temperatures

## Timeframe

Monthly averages of the sea surface temperature from January 1850 to December 2019.

## Values

The values for each grid cell give the mean sea surface temperature at that gridcell over the month. The values are given in degree celcius. When no data was available, either due to the gridcell being landmass or just not being recorded, the values are set to a number greater than 1e9.

## Source

The data was provided and downloaded from the NOAA PSL, Boulder, Colorado, USA, at: https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.cobe2.html

See also the script `nc_to_csv.py` to convert the files from the original HDF5-based format to CSV.
